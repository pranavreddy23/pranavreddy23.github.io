                    <h1>Hi, I'm Pranav</h1>
                    <p>
                        I’m deeply interested in systems that blend intelligence and performance — whether it's robots playing in simulated worlds or algorithms crunching through data at GPU scale.  
                        I’ve always been a technology enthusiast, drawn to complex systems and curious to learn what happens under the hood.  
                        I love working on exciting, hands-on problems, and I’m currently an open-source contributor at the <strong>Autoware Foundation</strong>, supporting autonomy stacks for self-driving systems.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from S.V. National Institute of Technology, Surat, where I laid the foundation for my engineering curiosity.  
                        After that, I pursued my Master’s in Computer Engineering at <strong>New York University</strong>, which helped me dive into both robotics and compute systems — two things I’ve come to love equally.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        Professionally, I’ve worked on real-time sensor and embedded systems at <strong>MultiCoreWare</strong>, and built system-level infrastructure for robotics deployments at <strong>TRC Robotics</strong>.  
                        Right now, I'm actively working on learning projects in <strong>CUDA programming</strong> and <strong>MJX/Brax-based reinforcement learning</strong>. These aren't just portfolio fillers — they’re my way of getting deeper into system-level programming and intelligent control, and learning the hard way (the right way).
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        Outside of tech, I live for sports. There are very few games I haven't tried — and fewer I wouldn't jump in to play.  
                        Cricket, tennis, volleyball — you name it. I’m always ready for a match, and fortunate to pick things up quickly.  
                        Martin Scorsese movies and pizza practically defined my teenage years, and to this day, I remain a lifelong fan of film, geopolitics, deep tech, and anything that sparks curiosity.
