                    <h1>Hi, I'm Pranav </h1>
                    <p>
                        I‚Äôm interested in systems that blend intelligence and performance, whether it's robots playing in simulated worlds or algorithms crunching through data at GPU scale.  
                        I‚Äôve always been curious to learn what happens under the hood.  
                        I love working on exciting, hands-on problems, and I‚Äôm currently an open-source contributor at the <strong>Autoware Foundation</strong>, supporting autonomy stacks for self-driving systems.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from S.V. National Institute of Technology, Surat, where I laid the foundation for my engineering curiosity.  
                        After that, I pursued my Master‚Äôs in Computer Engineering at <strong>New York University</strong>, which helped me dive into both robotics and compute systems.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        Professionally, I‚Äôve worked on real-time sensor and embedded systems at <strong>MultiCoreWare</strong>, and built system-level infrastructure for robotics deployments at <strong>TRC Robotics</strong>.  
                        Right now, I'm actively working on learning projects in <strong>CUDA programming</strong> and <strong>MJX/Brax-based reinforcement learning</strong>. These aren't just portfolio fillers,they‚Äôre my way of getting deeper into system-level programming and intelligent control, and learning the hard way (the right way).
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        Outside of tech, I live for sports. There are very few games I haven't tried.  
                        Cricket, tennis, volleyball ,you name it. I‚Äôm always ready for a match, and fortunate to pick things up quickly.  
                        Martin Scorsese movies and pizza practically defined my teenage years.You‚Äôll also catch me deep in a movie, reading up on geopolitics, deep tech, and anything that sparks curiosity.
                      </p>
                    <p>
