    Hi, I’m <strong>Pranav</strong>.<br>
    I like working on systems where you have to think about everything latency, safety, compute budgets, sensors, and how all the pieces behave under real constraints.  
    I enjoy building pipelines end-to-end, scratching my head over timing mismatches, and digging under the hood to understand how a system actually works.  
    Cyber-physical safety, performance, and sensor behavior are the things I care about the most.
</p>

<p>
    I completed my Master’s in Computer Engineering at <strong>New York University</strong>, where I worked on robotics, planning, and learning-enabled control.  
    Before that, I studied Electrical Engineering at <strong>SVNIT Surat</strong>, which built the foundation for all the systems work I do now.
</p>

<p>
    Professionally, I’m a Research Engineer at <strong>MultiCoreWare</strong>, working across compute, sensors, and embedded systems.  
    My work ranges from low-level driver debugging to radar/lidar modeling, GPU pipelines, server telemetry, and building dashboards for maintenance and remediation.

    I’m also an active contributor, and one of the core members of the Autoware Foundation’s <strong>POV project</strong>.  
    It’s one of my favorite things I work on, and if you’re curious, you can check out my GitHub or my Autoware contributions.

    Outside of tech, I live for sports. There are very few games I haven't tried.  
    Cricket, tennis, volleyball, you name it. I'm always ready for a match, and fortunate to pick things up quickly.  
    Martin Scorsese movies and pizza practically defined my teenage years. You'll also catch me deep in a movie, reading up on geopolitics, deep tech, and anything that sparks curiosity.
