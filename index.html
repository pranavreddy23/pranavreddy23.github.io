<h1>Hi, I'm Pranav</h1>
<p>
    I'm interested in systems that blend intelligence and performance, whether it's robots playing in simulated worlds or algorithms crunching through data at GPU scale.  
    I've always been curious to learn what happens under the hood.  
    I love working on exciting, hands-on problems, and I'm currently an open-source contributor at the <strong>Autoware Foundation</strong>, supporting autonomy stacks for self-driving systems.
</p>

<p>
    I completed my Master's in Computer Engineering at <strong>New York University</strong>, where I have worked on robotics and compute systems.
    My undergraduate degree is in Electrical Engineering from S.V. National Institute of Technology, Surat, where I laid the foundation for my engineering curiosity.  
</p>

<p>
    Professionally, I am working on sensor modelling ,compute and embedded systems at <strong>MultiCoreWare</strong>, and built system-level infrastructure for robotics deployments at <strong>TRC Robotics</strong>.  
    Right now, I'm actively working on learning projects in <strong>CUDA programming</strong> and <strong>MJX/Brax-based reinforcement learning</strong>, which means I'm perpetually GPU poor and always on the hunt for a spare NVIDIA core
</p>

<p>
    Outside of tech, I live for sports. There are very few games I haven't tried.  
    Cricket, tennis, volleyball, you name it. I'm always ready for a match, and fortunate to pick things up quickly.  
    Martin Scorsese movies and pizza practically defined my teenage years. You'll also catch me deep in a movie, reading up on geopolitics, deep tech, and anything that sparks curiosity.
